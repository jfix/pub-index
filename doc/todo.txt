todo
----

* encoding issue?
* from chapter to parent (see http://localhost:60045/chapter/eco_surveys-fin-2010-1-fr), currently hard-coded to /book/)
* url system (book/, chapter/, ...) is that useful?
* OK type ahead for search not really working (ui-wise)
* also, do we want to search for titles or for words or ... ?

* listing to take aspects of OECD.org lists, use thumbnails (needs search-transform?)



* OK: paging search results => basic, all pages always shown, clever limiting TODO 
* opensearch => description document ok, link ok, search results TODO, test TODO
* OK: rewrite => basic rewrite for display and search

* facets by: 
** topics
** country (show expandable list, or type ahead?) 
** language (select from a list of little icons?) 
** pubtype
** pub date (select slider)
** first letter (A-Z)

* search: OK (but some indexes need checking suggest/search differences)


* generic paging mechanism for both search/browse


* OK: suggest, but search kind of screws up TODO
* OK: wordcloud => looking at html code and algorithm for mapping


* slider thingy: list lates four publications (flagships?) + one page for upcoming
  ==> goes to a browse view primed with a time facet constraint
 
* google map: show bubbles (different sizes) for each country we handle, 
  ==> click on here leads to browse page primed by country facet


* embed L/M/S (script/div or iframe)
  * L: image + title + abstract + publication date + link 
  * M: thumbnail + title + date + link
  * S: title, date, link


* integration of online-reader?  easily possible (actually works already ...)


* federated search (basically ready) - opensearch.xml + rss results returned
