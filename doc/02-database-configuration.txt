h3. Fields

h4. suggest-field

This field is necessary to provide fast results for type-ahead in the search
box.  Right now, it is based on the words in the title and the abstract.

> Note: in order for this "field" to work, we need also "element word lexicons"
> for title and abstract to be created

TODO: what do we really want?
* suggest titles (i.e. search for and suggest phrases)
* suggest words (i.e. search for independent words only as done right now)

* index settings
** fast diacritic sensitive searches
** three character searches
** two character searches
** one character searches
** field value searches

[TODO - document sense of these collations]
* word lexicons
** http://marklogic.com/collation//S1
** http://marklogic.com/collation//S4

* include document root: false

* Included Elements

| title, abstract    | http://purl.org/dc/terms | 1.0 |
